# About The Project

Telegram bot for searching, uniting and interacting active people within the Armenian diaspora.

## Idea

In Moscow, I realized that I had no contacts with the Armenian diaspora. I would like to participate in her life, be a
volunteer, etc. But the search for like-minded people sometimes **takes a lot of time**.

The idea of ​​the bot is to be an assistant to an ordinary member of the diaspora. The bot provides information about
the main organizations, historical monuments, informal communities of Armenians in Moscow.

The bot also provides the functionality of an announcement board for volunteers. The main idea of ​​this board is to
enable everyone who has the opportunity to help those who need help.

## MVP

- Provide information about the main organizations, notify when adding new ones, if the user is subscribed to this
  category of organizations.
- Ability to add an announcement for volunteers.
- Opportunity to receive information about new announcements.
- Opportunity to respond to a ad.
